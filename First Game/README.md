# First Game in libGDC

## DesktopLauncher.java
- We set the title of our game
- We set the starting size of the screen

## MyGame.java
- We create the abstraction of a playable character
````java
// player
	Texture img;
	int x, y = 0;
	int size = 200;
````
- On every update of the game lifecycle, we check on keys pressed to move the character and to resize it
